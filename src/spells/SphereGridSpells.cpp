/*
 * The custom class spells of the sphere grid.
 *
 * FIFTEEN SCRIPTS ONLY, where thirty-one seemed needed: effect 27,
 * PERSISTENT_AREA_AURA, exists in 3.3.5 — it is what makes Consecration and
 * Rain of Fire. It drops a dynamic object at the target point that applies a
 * periodic aura to whoever stands there, and that alone covered every ground
 * area of ours: judgement, barrier, singularity, burns, angelic feather. Three
 * auras are enough to tell them apart — 87 for damage taken, 53 for the drain
 * that heals the caster, 3 for the burn. A damage cone, a cone heal and a
 * periodic channel are likewise written entirely in the DBC.
 *
 * What is left here is what no field can express: reading a resource, drawing
 * lots, measuring a distance, summoning, counting casts.
 *
 * THE DIRECTION RULE first, because every linear movement shares it: a leap goes
 * where the character IS GOING if he moves, and straight ahead if he stands
 * still.
