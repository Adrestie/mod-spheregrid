    Solstice and Equinox -- the celestial gauge, client side.

    Sent to the client by AIO: nothing to install, nothing to package.

    NO SECOND BAR IS DRAWN. The client already carries the EclipseBarFrame
    addon, a bar anchored under the player's portrait. We TAKE IT OVER rather
    than put another one beside it.

    WHAT THE ADDON DOES BY ITSELF, and what we replace:

      * it only shows for a druid in moonkin form (24858) -- which suits us,
        and is left alone;
      * its cursor follows the REMAINING DURATION of the game's own Eclipse
        buffs, 48517 (solar) and 48518 (lunar): xPos = +/-38 x (duration / 15);
      * it lights the solar or the lunar half, dims the other, and pulses a
        halo on the body reached, all from those same buffs.

    WHAT WE PUT IN ITS PLACE:

      * the cursor follows OUR gauge, xPos = 38 x notch / 3, the notch coming
        from the stacks of "Lunar gauge" (85132) and "Solar gauge" (85133).
        THOSE AURAS MUST STAY VISIBLE: marked as having no icon, they stopped
        being returned by UnitBuff and the cursor froze in the middle.
      * a half lights when AN END IS REACHED -- that is, when the player
        carries Solstice (85129, sun) or Equinox (85130, moon);
      * and the bar is put away for a druid who does NOT know the spell: the
        addon shows for any moonkin, which is one condition short of ours.

    The addon calls EclipseBar_Update from its own OnUpdate every frame, so
    replacing that one function is enough for everything to follow. OnShow and
    CheckBuffs are replaced too, without which the game's own buffs would take
    the lit halves back.

    /solstice prints what the client actually reads, so a disagreement can be
    settled rather than guessed at.
