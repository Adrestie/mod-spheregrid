    The player interface, server side.

    It serves the definition -- the module's tables in the world database, filled
    by the editor's import -- and the character's state, and relays purchases to
    the module's `.spheregrid activate` command, RUN AS THE PLAYER: every rule of
    the game applies there (the start, adjacency, the cost, the class) and the
    localised messages come from there. The module's writes are synchronous, so
    the state read back here is always fresh.

    It opens with .spheregrid show, /spheregrid, or the button on the talent
    window. THIS file owns the interception of `.spheregrid show`;
    editor/Editor.lua owns the one for `.spheregrid editor`.
