    The workbench, server side.

    Four recipes:

      fuse      3 identical stones           -> 1 stone of the quality above
      reroll    2 stones of the same quality -> 1 stone, same quality, other effect
      reforge   3 runes, any of them         -> 1 rune drawn from the catalogue
      grind     1 item                       -> Spherite, and the item is gone

    THIS FILE DECIDES NOTHING. It relays to the module's commands, which carry
    every rule and answer the player in their own language -- the same division
    as socketing. What it does do is serve the catalogue the client needs to
    recognise, among the bags, what can go into which recipe.

    It opens from the world object the module ships: the template comes with the
    SQL, and where it stands in the world is placed by hand.
