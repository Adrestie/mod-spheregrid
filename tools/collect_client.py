"""Collects into the module everything client side its content reaches.

    python tools/collect_client.py --source <client Data> --stock <client Data>
                                   [--locale-source frFR] [--dry-run]

Two outputs from ONE walk: the DBC rows the module adds client side, and every
file those rows name. Separating them would mean keeping the same walk twice.

`--source` is a client where the module already runs, `--stock` an untouched
one. What the first has and the second has not, AND the module's own content
names, is what has to travel with the module.

THE POINT IS THE WALK. A spell names a visual, a visual names kits, a kit names
effects and a sound, an effect names a model, and A MODEL NAMES ITS OWN
TEXTURES and the skin files the client will look for beside it. Stop anywhere
along that chain and the game draws a pink chequerboard, or nothing.

None of it lives on a server: SpellVisual, SpellVisualKit and
SpellVisualEffectName are never read there. Comparing two `Data/dbc` folders
sees nothing of this, which is exactly how it came to be missed.

This is an AUTHORING tool. It runs once, where both clients are, and its output
is what the module ships. An operator never runs it.

# WHAT MUST NOT TRAVEL UNDER ANOTHER SERVER'S NAME. The module was collected
# from a client that named its files after that server; the maps that turn
# those names into the module's own are the author's, and they live OUTSIDE
# the repository, in tools/local/origin.py (ignored by git). Without them the
# collector works at identity, which is right for anyone else: a clone has no
# such names to translate.
#
# HOW LONG THIS FILE IS MEANT TO LIVE. Not for ever. `data/` is what the
# module IS: its rows and its files are written by hand now, and everything
# fixed since it became a module of its own -- a beam, a display, two stacking
# auras, a ground kit, four model-info rows -- was written there directly and
# never collected. This file has ONE purpose left: bringing something NEW
# across from the server the module grew up in. The day nothing more is to
# come across, it leaves the published repository with tools/local/origin.py,
# and `data/` stands alone.
#
# Until then it is kept faithful: every row and file made by hand is named
# again below, in CORRECTIONS, DERIVED, EXTRA_FILES or MODULE_OWN, so that a
# collection reproduces exactly what the module ships rather than quietly
# undoing it. That is the price of keeping it, and it is paid on purpose.

# WHICH CLIENT TO COLLECT FROM. Only the one the module grew up in. A client
# the module's own installer patched carries the right names and needs no
# map -- but it is NOT a faithful source: the rows it BORROWS (54 visuals, 12
# kits, 3 effects, one display) are found by comparing the source against a
# stock client, and in a self-patched client no row of the game is altered.
# Collecting from one would leave borrowed.json empty and lose the copies.

# THE GAME'S ROWS THE MODULE USED TO REWRITE, and the identifiers of its own
# they are copied to. Row 8500 of GameObjectDisplayInfo is a Dalaran chair; the
# client the module grew up in had turned it into `11fx_phaseportal01`, which is
# what the death tunnel looks like. Rewriting it would change the chair for
# every server that installs the module, so the row is copied instead.

# field named after the language puts the French where nobody reads it.
